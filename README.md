# Courses

This repository contains curricula, syllabi, learning objectives, and instructional artifacts developed during the Lens Pilot.

Courses are designed to emphasize learning-by-doing, peer contribution, and mastery through participation. Materials may evolve over time as part of the pilot process.

This repository is the canonical source for course-related documents.
